# Lionsight

## Description

Our project let's you find contentious spaces on Wikipedia and the language and context of hostility.

## How to use

To run the web app locally, clone the repo and use wikiparser_3.py.

Pip install all necessary packages including Wikipedia, pandas, BeautifulSoup, re, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, datetime

run `<python wikiparser_3.py>`

Open the URL that pops up in the console and enter the title of the Wikipedia page.

If you want to run the algorithm on just the given wikipedia page enter 1 for the depth search. If you want to look at this page and similar pages enter 2-4 for the depth (2 will give fewer but more similar pages while 4 will give more pages which may be less similar to the original page).
